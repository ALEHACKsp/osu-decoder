## What is this?
This is a private tool I used to decrypt osu!'s symbol names, allowing me to view osu!'s code as if I got it from the original source. Since peppy changed his encryption key and it can no longer be considered public domain, I believe it is safe to publish this tool publicly.

If you are reading this and your name happens to be "Dean Herbert", 'sup. I was probably the first person to figure this out, but not the last. Multiple people have been using this to create publicly available cheats. It was about time you fixed this.

## Usage
It has a help menu, you can figure it out.

## It doesn't work!
As of 26/03/2019, peppy has reportedly changed the encryption key used for encrypting symbol names. This tool will only work on osu! builds before that date (that are still obfuscated by EazFuscator).
